Holy moly


[11/12/2024 10:48] 0xhelium
7110 - 1610 diff … This is too much for an error


[11/12/2024 12:23] decap1703
will Zenith audit report be available?

ℹ️ Noting that the scope for this audit is ~7000 LOC as the language is Golang.  The original RSVP has been updated as well.

From 1.6K to 7K? This is a big diff. I initially scheduled few days for this contest as it was 1.6K sloc only, but now I'm obliged to drop off given that it is 7K and few days are definitely not enough for it.
Hope such big diffs won't happen again as it is hard for us to schedule contests timeline properly.

Sometimes the information can change from when we post the RSVP to when we launch the audit, but I completely understand and hear your concerns.

Anyone know what requirements I have to install before running installation? I’m getting recipe error. @Unique Divine @Oleg N  @k_yang


[11/17/2024 00:11] uniquedivine
The Go dependencies or the npm ones?

[11/17/2024 00:59] uniquedivine
I'd recommend the latest Golang version and updating the standard libraries inside 

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

[11/17/2024 00:59] uniquedivine
or the equivalent

I discovered a critical vulnerability outside the scope that affects all the funds on the chain. I have already constructed a Proof of Concept (PoC) and verified this vulnerability. You can quickly verify it too. Could this vulnerability be considered within the scope? Please let me know. If it can be included in the scope, I can submit it.


[11/18/2024 02:32] kartoonjoy
Please read the [doc](<https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/wardens/submission-guidelines#how-to-submit-zero-day-or-otherwise-highly-sensitive-bugs>) for how to proceed.

Hello, I'd like to ask that if I submit according to the submission methods mentioned above (such as submitting reports within the stipulated time, following the correct format, including necessary contents and other relevant requirements), will it help to improve my ranking in the Code4rena competition? I hope to get your definite reply. Thank you.


[11/18/2024 23:15] zsystm
Why do you think your findings are out of scope? Which file is your finding related to? It seems like it would likely fall within the scope

Not sure. I have Go installed. But I get an error when the ‘just install’ gets to line 9 where it says ‘Make Install’. It seems that my MacOS does not like that command and never has. What is the alternative command to ‘Make Install’ on the newer Macs? I cannot access the directory it is trying to copy to in MacOs new>> bin/…


[11/20/2024 08:01] flackoon
Sounds like you might need to install `build-essential`, but that's just a guess based on my experience with setting the project up on a ubuntu VM.

Thanks. I’ll try it.

Still on the same track or we should embrace ourselves for one more week 😅 ?

It's in the works but to take the pressure off of us, I'm going to tell you to brace yourself for another week. 😅
